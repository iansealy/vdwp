<p>Using Firefox or Chrome and the <a href="http://chrispederick.com/work/web-developer/" target="_blank">Web Developer toolbar</a>:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Open a random sample of Web pages.</li>
    <li>Use the 'Hide Background Images' option in the Web Developer toolbar to hide and show background images on a page.</li>
    <li>Use 'Disable All Styles' to turn off the CSS to see whether the page still makes sense.</li>
    <li>You could also have a go at saving some of the background images you find to use in the next task. In Firefox you can right click on a background image and choose the option 'View Background Image' then Ctrl-S to save it</li>
</ul>
