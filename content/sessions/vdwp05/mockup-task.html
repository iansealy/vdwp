<p>Use Photoshop to create a mock-up of a digital portfolio.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Download the <a href="modulargrid_ruled.psd">modular grid (4x4)</a> and open it in Photoshop.</li>
    <li>Open an existing image and make a square selection from it, copy it, then paste this selection into your grid. Repeat this with a number of other images.</li>
    <li>Use the grid to help you size the images and create the layout.</li>
    <li>Try making a 200px x 200px selection and pasting a new image into it. Move the image around inside the selection and resize it.</li>
    <li>Move the images around the grid and group them in different ways.</li>
    <li>Put all of the image layers into a folder, duplicate it and rearrange the images in a different layout.</li>
