<p>After the {{< sessionname "session01name" >}} session, you may like to look at some of these resources.</p>

<p>If you're not very confident with HTML then you <strong>must</strong> read these tutorials.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Introduction">Introduction to HTML</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Guide/">Getting started with HTML</a>
<li><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/">HTML School</a>
</ul>

<p>There's really no need to spend money buying books about learning HTML because all the information you need is available online. But if you work offline a lot and need a good HTML reference book then I recommend:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321928830/iansealycom">HTML and CSS: Visual QuickStart Guide</a></li>
</ul>

<p>If you desperately want a book about learning HTML then I recommend:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672336146/iansealycom">Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The definitive reference for what's allowed in HTML 4 (the version of HTML we've looked at so far) is:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/">HTML 4.01 Specification</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It's not what you'd call light reading though.</p>
