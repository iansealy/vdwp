<p>Have a go at animating the images in this <a href="Media_css_looping_animation" target="_blank">example page</a>. You can <a href="Media_css_looping_animation.zip">download</a> all of the resources in a zip file.</p>
<p>The background images are 240px x 120px.</p>
<p>You'll need the following CSS properties:</p>
<ul>	
	<li>animation - to name the animation</li>
	<li>animation-duration - to set how long the animation runs for in seconds (2s)</li>
	<li>animation-iteration-count - to set how many times the animation runs</li>
	<li>animation-timing-function - to set whether the animation runs evenly or eases in or out</li>	
</ul>
