    <h1>How GIF Animation Works</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>GIF animation works by 'layering' images and 'flicking' through them to create movement.</li>
        <li>To create a GIF animation you need to use specific software which allows you to save GIF images as animations.</li>
        <li>The image is then included in a Web page in the usual way but when it's loaded into a page in a browser all of the layered images are shown in sequence. The sequence can be set to run any number of times or indefinitely (looped).</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Planning a GIF Animation</h1>
    <p>It helps to storyboard your animation before you start using GIF animation software. The storyboard need only be a rough plan of the frames in sequence but it will save time if you know in advance the content of each frame.</p>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>Building your GIF Animation</h1>
    <p>It is important to consider the file size of your animation at the planning stage. A large GIF animation will take a long time to download. The more frames your animation has the larger the file size will be.</p>
    <p>Think about achieving your aim in the simplest way with the fewest frames. Some sites specify a maximum file size for animated banners included on a page.</p>

<div class="slide">
    <h1>GIF Limitations</h1>
    <p>Also bear in mind at the planning stage the limitations and advantages of the GIF file format. These are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduced colour</li>
        <li>Not good for photographs</li>
        <li>Good at compressing areas of colour</li>
        <li>Good with text (especially aliased text)</li>
    </ul>
