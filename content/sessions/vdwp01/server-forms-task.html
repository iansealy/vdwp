<ul>
    <li>Read the tutorials</li>
    <li>Create a feedback form for your own Web site</li>
    <li>Your form should collect the user's name, email address, age and comments</li>
    <li>Download <a href="https://www.tectite.com/formmail.zip">Tectite FormMail</a> and integrate it with your contact form</li>
    <li>In brief, you'll need to download the script, unzip it, open it in Brackets and make appropriate changes to the script (editing $TARGET_EMAIL at a minimum), upload it to your Web space and finally change your form in a similar way to sampleform.htm.</li>
    <li>For more info, read the comments in the script and the sample form.</li>
</ul>
