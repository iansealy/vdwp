<h1>eCommerce</h1>
<p>eCommerce covers more than online sales:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Real-time stock levels</li>
<li>Creation of estimates</li>
<li>Auctions</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we'll be focusing on online sales.</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Value to the economy</h1>
<p>Online sales are a significant proportion of the economy.</p>
<p>Crucially it makes international trade easier.</p>
<ul>
<li>UK consumers spent over <a href="https://www.imrg.org/media-and-comment/press-releases/uk-online-sales-in-2016/" target="_blank">&pound;130 billion online in 2016</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gurufocus.com/news/492058/uk-online-shopping-and-ecommerce-statistics-for-2017" target="_blank">87% of the UK population shop online</a></li>
<li>Total annual growth in online shopping within the UK is <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/november2017#whats-the-story-in-online-sales" target="_blank">was 10%
 between 2016 and 2017</a></li>
 <li><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/retailindustry/bulletins/retailsales/november2017#whats-the-story-in-online-sales" target="_blank">&pound;1.2 billion average weekly spend</a> online in Great Britain in 2017</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Online sales</h1>
<p>Can be done in many ways but rely on some, or all, of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product catalogue</li>
<li>Shopping cart/basket</li>
<li>Collection of delivery information</li>
<li><em>Online payment</em></li>
<li>Order tracking</li>
</ul>
<p>In many cases &quot;Online payment&quot; is handled by a third party.</p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Selling online</h1>
<p>Many different ways to sell products or services online.</p>
<p>Can be broadly categorised as:</p>
<ol>
<li>Simple forms on your site</li>
<li>Selling on someone else's site</li>
<li>Hosted shops</li>
<li>Running your own shop</li>
</ol>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Simple forms</h1>
<p>Third parties provide code/instructions, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/standard" target="_blank">PayPal Payments Standard</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to implement, just add their code to your site</li>
<li>Useful if you have few products</li>
<li>Doesn't scale well</li>
<li>Not always easy/possible to customise</li>
<li>Some rely solely on JavaScript for shopping cart functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.benhs.org.uk/publications/british-hoverflies-an-illustrated-identification-guide-second-edition/" target="_blank">Simple PayPal integration</a></p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>



<div class="slide">
<h1>Selling on someone else's site - 1</h1>
<p>Some existing sites allow you to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Compete with other merchants for orders</li>
<li>Add products to their catalogue</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://services.amazon.co.uk/services/sell-online/features-and-benefits.html" target="_blank">Sell on Amazon</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161232" target="_blank">Amazon Marketplace</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cafepress.co.uk/cp/info/sell/index.aspx?area=learn&amp;page=learn" target="_blank">CafePress</a></li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>



<div class="slide">
<h1>Selling on someone else's site - 2</h1>
<p>Pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop hosted/maintained by someone else</li>
<li>Orders sometimes fulfilled by third party</li>
<li>Not practical if you have niche products</li>
<li>Benefit by association</li>
<li>Often little or no control of look and feel</li>
<li>Hard to integrate with an existing web site</li>
<li>Others take a (bigger) cut of profits</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <a href="http://www.cafepress.co.uk/profile/marvel" target="_blank">Marvel products on Cafe Press</a></p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Hosted shops</h1>
<p>Shop software written and hosted by a third party. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://pages.ebay.com/storefronts/start.html" target="_blank">eBay stores</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.3dcart.com/" target="_blank">3Dcart</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bluepark.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bluepark</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.actinic.co.uk/" target="_blank">Actinic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shop hosted/maintained by someone else</li>
<li>Admin area for you to run your shop</li>
<li>Often have some control over look and feel by picking themes</li>
<li>Can be hard to integrate with an existing web site</li>
</ul>

<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Hosting your own shop</h1>
<p>Host a shop using software written by yourself or a third party. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.zen-cart.com/" target="_blank">Zen Cart</a></li>
<li><a href="http://magento.com/UK" target="_blank">Magento</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.opencart.com/" target="_blank">OpenCart</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Often have complete flexibility over look and feel</li>
<li>Some software allows you to edit core code to change shop functionality</li>
<li>Hosting and upgrades can be tricky/expensive</li>
<li>Easy to integrate with an existing web site</li>
</ul>
<p>Example: <a href="https://www.graze.com/uk/shop/" target="_blank">Graze shop</a></p>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Accepting online payments</h1>
<p>If hosting your own shop or using a hosted shop you'll need a way for people to pay you.</p>
<p>There are three ways to take online payments</p>
<ol>
<li>Collecting and processing credit card details yourself
	<ul>
	<li>Often only practical for large companies</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/" target="_blank">Payment Card Industry (PCI) Data Security Standards</a> are difficult for small business to achieve</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Using a Merchant account</li>
<li>Using a Payment gateway</li>
</ol>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Merchant account</h1>
<p>Using a &quot;Merchant account&quot; requires two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acquiring bank - a bank (usually a high street bank) that will process credit card sales</li>
<li>Internet Merchant Service - a service that allows you to accept cards  online by using a Payment Service Provider (PSP) that passes the details to the acquiring bank</li>
</ol>

<p>Example: <a href="https://www.barclaycard.co.uk/business/accepting-payments" target="_blank">Barclaycard</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Provides both a Merchant account with an Acquiring bank and an Internet Merchant Service</li>
<li>Costs now hidden behind a quote tool but were:
<ul>
<li>Monthly fee = &pound;20 per month (+ VAT)</li>
<li>Transaction charge = 10p per transaction (+ VAT)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>



<div class="slide">
<h1>Merchant account - pros and cons</h1>
<p>Pros and cons of a Merchant account:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you already process card payments (e.g. you run a physical shop) it can be quick to set up</li>
<li>Payment is often via a &quot;well known&quot; bank/company</li>
<li>Starting from scratch can require credit checks and take several months for approval</li>
<li>May be refused if you have no trading history</li>
<li>You usually need to pay for the Payment Service Provider</li>
<li>Acquiring Bank also charge a percentage of each transaction</li>
<li>Banks may want to see a business plan or other documentation</li>
<li>Some business types may be rejected:-
<ul>
<li>Gambling</li>
<li>Selling replica products</li>
<li>Medical supplies/pharmacy</li>
<li>Selling &quot;adult&quot; products</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Payment gateways - 1</h1>
<p>Payment gateways use their own acquiring services so they act as the Acquiring bank <strong>and</strong> provide the Internet Merchant Service.</p>
<p>Payment Gateways make money by taking a very small amount from lots and lots of transactions.</p>

<p>Pros and cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to set up</li>
<li>Often well known and customers may have an account already</li>
<li>No credit checks - authorisation commonly by way of associated credit card account</li>
<li>No need for a business plan</li>
<li>Funds often held for the first 30-60 days after an account opened as fraud prevention measure</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Payment gateways - 2</h1>
<p>Pros and cons continued:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to integrate with an online shop</li>
<li>Easy to issue refunds</li>
<li>Charges are low:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/paypal-fees" target="_blank">PayPal</a> - 1.9%-3.4% + &pound;0.20 per transaction</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.sagepay.co.uk/our-payment-solutions/online-payments/pricing" target="_blank">Sage Pay</a> - &pound;20.90 a month</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/en-gb" target="_blank">Stripe</a> - 1.4%-2.9% + &pound;0.20 per transaction</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>



<div class="slide">
<h1>Security issues 1</h1>
<p>Security issues to consider when running online shops.</p>

<ul>
<li>Data sent over Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)
	<ul>
	<li>SSL encrypts the data sent back and forth between server and browser so it can't be read en-route</li>
	<li>SSL should be used whenever personal data is requested - not just when collecting payment details (Google also uses <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html" target="_blank">SSL as a ranking signal</a>)</li>
	<li>SSL encryption should also be used in the admin area of your shop</li>
	<li>SSL certificates, and the additional server setup required, usually adds to your hosting costs. SSL certificates can cost more than hosting: free - &pound;1000+ but often ~&pound;100</li>
	<li>An aside - never send credit card details by email</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Access control
	<ul>
	<li>Only those that need access to the admin areas of the shop should have access</li>
	<li>Choose <a href="https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2012/04/zxcvbn-realistic-password-strength-estimation/" target="_blank">strong passwords</a></li>
<li>Don't re-use passwords!</li>
<li>Use a password manager (<a href="https://lastpass.com/" target="_blank">LastPass</a>, <a href="http://keepass.com/" target="_blank">KeePass</a> etc.)</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Security issues 2</h1>

<ul>
<li>Third party shop software
	<ul>
	<li>Choosing software
		<ul>
		<li>Read reviews</li>
		<li>Check rate of releases</li>
		<li>How active is the community?</li>
		<li>Check <a href="https://secuniaresearch.flexerasoftware.com/community/advisories/" target="_blank">Secunia</a> for unpatched security issues</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Review the initial setup</li>
	<li>Remove any shop components you don't need</li>
	<li>Subscribe to relevant mailing lists so you are informed of:
		<ul>
		<li>Updates and patches to software</li>
		<li>New versions of software</li>
		<li>Bug reports</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Security issues 3</h1>

<ul>
<li>Backups
	<ul>
	<li>Make sure you have backups of the data
		<ul>
		<li>Automate</li>
		<li>Choose a sensible frequency</li>
		<li>Keep sequential backups</li>
		<li>Don't keep backups in the same place as the original data</li>
		<li>Not just good practice for online shops - your project work?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Don't rely on your host for backups... ever... ever... ever</li>
	<li>Encrypt backups</li>
	</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues overview</h1>
<p>There are a variety of laws covering online sales, including:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 and amendments 2005</li>
<li>Electronic Commerce (EC Directive) Regulations 2002</li>
<li>Data Protection Act 1998 and General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (implementation May 2018)</li>
<li>Sale of Goods Act 1979 - ensures seller has the right to sell, the product is as expected, product of satisfactory quality</li>
<li>Equality Act 2010 - accessibility</li>
<li>Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (and amendments in 2004 and 2011) - covers email marketing, cookies and spam</li>
<li>VAT changes in 2015</li>
</ul>

<p>An <strong>overview</strong> of the first three are provided on the following slides (plus a little about Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations and VAT changes). However, I'm not a lawyer, so you should familiarise yourself with the legal issues associated with running an eCommerce site. A good place to start is <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/guides/?topics=327" target="_blank">Out-Law.com</a></p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - Distance Selling Regulations</h1>
<p>Provides consumers the right to:-</p>

<ul>
<li>Prior to purchase, information about:
	<ul>
	<li>the supplier</li>
	<li>the goods/service being purchased</li>
	<li>the process of the sale</li>
	<li>delivery costs</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>notification of the 7 day cancellation period</li>
<li>what happens in the event of goods being unavailable</li>
<li>confirmation of the above in writing (email not a web page)</li>
<li>protection from card fraud</li>
</ul>

<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - Ecommerce regulations 1</h1>
<p>Ecommerce sites must provide, in an easily accessible location, certain information to customers. For example:-</p>

<ul>
<li>the name of the service provider</li>
<li>an email address of the provider - a contact form is insufficient</li>
<li>a postal address for the supplier</li>
<li>clear details of pricing, including postage and packing</li>
<li>company/charity registration number and membership number for any professional bodies</li>
<li>VAT number, if business is VAT registered
	<ul>
	<li>Must display VAT number anyway</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>also new rules mean you need to notify customers of <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2016/january/european-commission-publicises-link-to-new-online-dispute-resolution-platform-/" target="_blank">online dispute resolution platform</a> if you are an EU business selling online to EU customers</li>
</ul>
<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - Ecommerce regulations 2</h1>
<p>The regulations also state:</p>
<ul>
<li>must provide means to correct errors in order before the order placed</li>
<li>confirmation of order must be provided ASAP after order placed</li>
<li>provide clear terms and conditions including how/when the contract is formed
	<ul>
	<li>Critical for protection against pricing errors</li>
	</ul>
</li>
<li>Provide details of the languages offered for the conclusion of the contract</li>
</ul>

<h1>Legal issues - Data Protection</h1>

<p>Anyone who processes <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/key_definitions#personal-data" target="_blank">personal information</a> must comply with eight principles of the Data Protection Act, which make sure that personal information is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fairly and lawfully processed</li>
<li>Processed for limited purposes</li>
<li>Adequate, relevant and not excessive</li>
<li>Accurate and up to date</li>
<li>Not kept for longer than is necessary</li>
<li>Processed in line with your rights</li>
<li>Secure</li>
<li>Not transferred to other countries without adequate protection</li>
</ol>
<p>Source: Office of the Information Commissioner &#8211; <a href="https://ico.org.uk/" target="_blank">https://ico.org.uk/</a></p>

<div class="handout">
</div>
</div>


<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - Data Protection - transferring data</h1>

<p>One of the eight principles ensures that personal information is:</p>

<ul>
<li>not transferred to other countries without adequate protection</li>
</ul>

<p>Almost all countries outside of the European Economic Area (EEA) <strong>do not</strong> have adequate protection.</p>

<p>Do you know where your data is?</p>

<ul>
<li>Where is your site hosted?</li>
<li>Where does the host back up that data to?</li>
</ul>

<p>Until 2015 companies within the US could sign up to the &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Safe_Harbor_Privacy_Principles" target="_blank">Safe Harbor</a>&quot; scheme.</p>

<p>In October 2015, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that data transfer under 'Safe Harbor' are <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2015/october/eu-us-data-transfers-invalid-if-made-under-safe-harbour-regime-rules-eu-court/" target="_blank">invalid</a></p>

<p>Privacy Shield, the replacement for 'Safe Harbor', is still <a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2016/april/businesses-should-not-rely-on-privacy-shield-in-light-of-watchdog-criticisms-warn-experts/" target="_blank">drawing criticism</a>. Companies may take out an individual contract with any supplier (irrespective of the country they reside in) to ensure analogous levels of protection.</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - GDPR</h1>

<p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) replaces the Data Protection Act in May 2018.</p>

<ol>
<li>Changes requirements on information that must be given at the time of data collection</li>
<li>Must inform people of the lawful basis used for data processing</li>
<li>Must provide details of data retention</li>
<li>Right to erasure and refusal</li>
<li>Fines for data breaches</li>
<li>Additional restrictions for processing data about children</li>
</ol>

<div class="slide">
<h1>Legal issues - Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations</h1>

<p>Covers email marketing etc, however...</p>

<p>2011 amendments to the regulations state that cookies or similar devices must not be used unless the subscriber or user:</p>

<ul>
<li>is provided with clear and comprehensive information about the purposes of the storage of, or access to, that information; and</li>
<li>is given the opportunity to refuse the storage of, or access to, that information.</li>
</ul>

<p>The only exceptions are cookies that are &quot;strictly necessary&quot; for provision of a service (e.g. shopping carts).</p>

<p>The regulations were described as &quot;<a href="http://www.out-law.com//default.aspx?page=10510" target="_blank">breathtakingly stupid</a>&quot; but came in to force on 26th May 2011 (the ICO gave organisations <a href="http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/regulation/2011/05/25/cookie-law-wont-bite-for-a-year-40092886/" target="_blank">12 months to comply</a>).</p>

<p>Law has wider implications than for eCommerce sites but was changed at the last moment (May 2012) to include '<a href="http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2012/may/ico-publishes-new-guidance-on-implied-consent-to-cookies/" target="_blank">implied consent</a>' .</p>

<p>Should be an <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk/2017/01/10/cookie-law-reform-announcement/" target="_blank">end to cookie pop-ups</a> in May 2018</p>

<div class="slide">
<h1>VAT changes 2015</h1>
<p>VAT rules changed to remove unfair competition from EU member states with lower VAT rates.</p>

<p>Rules relate to the sale of digital goods to individuals and non business entities (e.g. charities) in another EU member state. Change requires the VAT rate used to be that of the location of the purchaser not seller.</p>
<ul>
<li>Applies even if you are <strong>not VAT registered</strong></li>
<li>Need to determine customer location (until 30 June 2015 could use data supplied by payment service provider) and charge VAT at the rate in the customer's location</li>
<li>Doesn't apply to physical goods sold online, booking services or teaching delivered online</li>

<li>Businesses can either
<ul>
<li>Register to pay VAT in each EU member state</li>
<li>If business is below VAT threshold can register for the VAT Mini One Stop Shop (VAT MOSS). VAT MOSS allows businesses to submit one return, pay HMRC, and payments to the member states are handled by HMRC rather than by the business.</li>
